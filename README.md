# InfoSec Resource Dump
A personal and ongoing collection of a variety of cybersecurity-related resources and tools (free and paid), including those for learning and studying, research, websites, blogs, repos, and anything else I find interesting.

This repo is an attempt to centralize my collection of learning resources, tools, services, projects, etc., in a variety of categories that would serve anyone interested in cybersecurity, or starting or transitioning to a cyber-related career. My journey into cybersecurity began with curiosity and a drive to learn. Starting out, I found that many "beginner" focused learning resources and tools assumed some pre-obtained knowledge, and so I had to go about finding ways to learn things in order to keep going and not lose momentum. I hope to use this repo as a kitchen-sink for resources at all levels. As I work out the organization I will continue to collect resources here.
